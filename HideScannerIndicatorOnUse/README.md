# Hide Scanner Indicator On Use
Automatically hides the ? indicator that appears over interactables from Radar Scanners upon interaction.

By default it just hides the indicator regardless of completion (meaning that the indicator will re-show after scanning again), but you can configure it to only hide multi-use interactables when they're out of charges.
