# Death Message Above Corpse

This mod recreates a feature from the original Risk of Rain where your death message would appear above your dead body. The messages were grabbed from the ror1 wiki, and can include Starstorm death messages via config.

For intended results, everyone must have the same config. I wouldn't recommend turning the setting on for every corpse unless you reduce the duration.

## Translations
For all languages except English, I did a quick machine translation using the free version of DeepL and Google Translate where DeepL was not applicable. If it seems wrong, well that's why. In case you want to update it with proper translations, submit a request on github.

## To-do
1. Use original game font
2. Remove death message from chat (IL :\\)
3. Show death message on HUD for client in multiplayer
4. Get proper translations
