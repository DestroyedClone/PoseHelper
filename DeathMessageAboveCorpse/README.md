# Death Message Above Corpse
This mod recreates a feature from the original Risk of Rain where your death message would appear above your dead body. The messages were grabbed from the ror1 wiki, and can include Starstorm death messages via config.

For intended results, everyone must have the same config. I wouldn't recommend turning the setting on for every corpse unless you reduce the duration.

## To-do
1. Use original game font
2. Remove death message from chat (IL :\\)
3. Show death message on HUD for client
