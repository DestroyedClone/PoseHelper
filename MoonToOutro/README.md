# Moon to Outro
Basically used just for seeing your outro flavortext. You need to be in-game for this to work. You can just start a new run then immediately run the command.

Use "**skipmoon**" in console to complete the escape sequence and auto progress to the outro scene. Because this is done through a command, it means that if you want to go on the moon normally, then you're not impeded.
