Adds custom survivor pods for each survivor with unique effects. The effects aren't meant to be majorly game-changing due to the fact that pods (normally) only spawn on the first stage. It's more "neat!" than anything, to be honest. 

Changes:
 - All survivors who become unable to have a Fuel Array on their pod will spawn one after landing.
 - Due to networking, some changes are singleplayer (or probably host, can't test properly) only. They're prefixed by <sup>*host*</sup>. To be fixed...

 - **Acrid**
	 - Falls down like other survivors, instead of waking on the ground
	 - Upon landing, cover the ground in acid.
