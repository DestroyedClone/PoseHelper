[![github issues/request link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DestroyedClone/PoseHelper/master/PoseHelper/github_link.webp)](https://github.com/DestroyedClone/PoseHelper/issues) [![discord invite](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DestroyedClone/PoseHelper/master/PoseHelper/discord_link.webp)](https://discord.gg/DpHu3qXMHK)

Makes gold chests drop one item per player. Intended to make stages like Abyssal Depths and Sundered Grove less of a downside in comparison to Siren's Call.

Configuration:

 - Chest cost multiplier
 - Option to only affect the guaranteed chests of Abyssal Depths and Sundered Grove

Patched for SOTV

v1.0.11 - Adjusted check for GoldChestForAll preventing chests from dropping items when the specific chest config is enabled
