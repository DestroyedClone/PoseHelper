# View All Viewables
Stuff you haven't viewed yet have a yellow highlight over them, so this mod adds a command that views all unviewed viewables.

Usage: 

 1. Start a singleplayer lobby
 2. Open Console (Ctrl + Alt + `)
 3. "viewall", enter.
 4. Freeze for ~10 seconds

This command may or may not be destructive, so I'd recommend backing up your profile. This mod is mainly for those with profiles that reset alot and/or use UnlockAll alot.

The freeze time was about 10 seconds on a fresh vanilla profile, so your mileage will vary.
