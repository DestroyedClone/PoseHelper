While playing the game, things you haven't viewed yet have a yellow highlight over them that requires you to mouse over them to "view" them, removing the highlight. This mod adds a command that "views" all unviewed things. Do not confused this mod with unlocking all locked things.

Usage: 

 1. Start a singleplayer lobby
 2. Open Console (Ctrl + Alt + `)
 3. "viewall", enter.

This mod is mainly for those with profiles that reset alot and/or use UnlockAll alot.

# Changelog
v1.1.0 - Performance Adjustment
- Config: (Disabled by default) Prints the name of the viewed viewable to console.
	- The cause of the freezing was actually printing the name to console for every unviewed pretty much all at once. For performance, it is disabled.
- Config: (Enabled) View For All Local Users: If there are more than one local user active (splitscreen?) then it will view that content for all users. Otherwise, it will only view it for the first user.

v1.0.0 - Release
