Some monsters, including [Beetles](https://riskofrain2.fandom.com/wiki/Beetle) are momentarily hitstunned for hits that deal more than 20% of their health. The values might be different for each enemy, but regardless:
This artifact should prevent all enemies from getting hitstunned.
Uses the Artifact of Evolution sprites because I'm lazy.
Mod used in preview is [HenryMod](https://thunderstore.io/package/rob/HenryMod/)
