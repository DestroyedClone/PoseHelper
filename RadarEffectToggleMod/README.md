# Radar Effect Toggle
Have you ever used a Radar Scanner and thought, "Wow that's pretty bright"?
Have you ever used a Radar Scanner with a Gesture of the Drowned and thought, "Wow, this really sucks!"?
Comes with four toggles for it.

* Remove Post Processing
	* Enable to remove the bright light that fades out on scan.
* Remove Point Light
	* Enable to remove the small light that's emitted at your location.
* Remove Shaking
	* Enable to remove the shaking upon scanning. More noticeable when you constantly scan.
* Disable Effect
	* Enable to immediately remove the effect entirely. Doesn't affect the actual scan.

I recommend using it with [AnnoyingFilter](https://thunderstore.io/package/NetherCrowCSOLYOO/AnnoyingFilter/) by [NetherCrowCSOLYOO](https://thunderstore.io/package/NetherCrowCSOLYOO/) which removes the filter from brainstalks and tonic.

You need R2API and BepinEx.

## Changelog

* 1.1.0
	* Clarified config text
	* Added shake emitter
	* Improved disabling the effect
	* Removed network requirement
* 1.0.0 - Release
