# Radar Effect Toggle
Have you ever used a Radar Scanner and thought, "Wow that's pretty bright"?
Have you ever used a Radar Scanner with a Gesture of the Drowned and though, "Wow, this really sucks!"?
Comes with three toggles for the worst parts of it.
* Post Processing
	* When your screen goes all bright then fades out.
* Point Light
	* The little bright light that appears when you scan
* Early Death
	* It just kills the effect immediately. Since it's just an effect, the actual scanning is unaffected.

I recommend using it with [AnnoyingFilter](https://thunderstore.io/package/NetherCrowCSOLYOO/AnnoyingFilter/) by [NetherCrowCSOLYOO](https://thunderstore.io/package/NetherCrowCSOLYOO/) which removes the filter from brainstalks and tonic.

You need R2API and BepinEx.
