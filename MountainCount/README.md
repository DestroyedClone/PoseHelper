Adds some chat commands regarding shrine use count for teleporters. This mod is *not* vanilla-safe, and players without the mod will not see changed tokens correctly.

 - `x?` / `x ?`
	 - Outputs shrine use count for all teleporter shrines
	 - Outputs the result of `mtn?` if no associated mods are installed.
 - `xtotal?`
	 - Outputs the estimated amount of items each person should get.
 - `xm?` / `xmtn?`
	 - Shrine of the Mountain
 - `xsky?` (Requires ExtraChallengeShrines)
	 - Shrine of the Sky
 - `xwind?` (Requires ExtraChallengeShrines)
	 - Shrine of the Wind
 - `xearth?` (Requires ExtraChallengeShrines)
	 - Shrine of the Earth
