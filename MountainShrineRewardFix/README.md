# Boss Drop Reward Delay

This mod adds a short delay between rewards from the teleporter drops. Since modding can increase the amount of drops to high values (such as 16 playercounts x 4 mountain shrines), the amount of drops that are produced becomes too much for the system to handle, either resulting in a long-lasting lagspike or a crash.

The configuration defaults to 0.3s, but the values can be adjusted by the user.
