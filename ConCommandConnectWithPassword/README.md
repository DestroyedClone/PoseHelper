# Console Command Connect Includes Password
The console command `connect ip:port` doesn't have an argument for a password. You need to do `cl_password {password}` then `connect ip:port`.

This mod adds a password argument to `connect` so that you can now do: `connect ip:port {password}`, wow! the help text isn't changed because i dont know how to but it should have no impact as long as you know the mod is installed.
