This mod makes it so that whenever a line of text is added to the game, it is switched to one of the available languages and stored. 

Command: `randlanguage_clear` to clear the current stored language strings so that new ones can be regenerated.

Credit to iDeathHD for code fix.

The configuration allows you to set certain languages (such as if you wanted only English and Spanish strings), and an option to make generated strings persistent (enabled by default)
