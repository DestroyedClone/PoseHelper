## Scrolling

Did you know that you can actually scroll up in chat just a little bit for the first few messages before it gets too far from the chat? Hopoo Quirk probably

This mod allows you to scroll up in chat with either the scrollwheel or by dragging.

The only issue is that the very top of the chat that can be scrolled is the opposite of this edit. You'll see it at the end of the preview image where the cursor gets the line underneath it as if I'm over something clickable. I also found out that that small region lets you click and drag to select the text for whatever reason.

No I don't know how to fix this, and No I have no idea how to make functional scrollbar

## Fade

You can adjust the **Fade Delay** and the **Fade Duration** of the chatbox. Fade Delay is how long before it starts fading, and Fade Duration is the time it takes to fade to full transparency.

## Chat Expand Mode

* Disabled
* Expanded = While the input is open, your visible chat increases by about 5 lines
* Unlimited = All messages can show up on screen, can cover your screen.
