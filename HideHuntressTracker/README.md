This mod hides Huntress's tracking thing if she has [Visions of Heresy](https://riskofrain2.fandom.com/wiki/Visions_of_Heresy) and the [Hooks of Heresy](https://riskofrain2.fandom.com/wiki/Hooks_of_Heresy), since her primary and secondary being replaced means that her tracker has no use. Arguably, the tracking thing staying active is also misleading, as your primary and secondary will go towards your crosshair instead of that.
