# FUCK EQUIPMENT DRONES

TIRED OF YOUR FUCKING FRIENDS GIVING FUCKING METEORS TO THE FUCKING EQUIPMENT DRONE THAT FIRES IT A BILLION FUCKING TIMES FASTER? TIRED OF TRIPPING AND GIVING YOUR WINGS TO A MACHINE SO YOU GET TURNED BACK INTO A FEATHER-FUCKING-LESS BI-PED? OOPS I FUCKING GAVE THE DRONE MY FUCKING ONE IN THREE BILLION CHANCE AFFIX? WELL LOOK NO FUCKING FUTHER CAUSE HERE'S A FUCKING MOD FOR RISK OF RAIN 2.

It's configurable, separate each equipment index with commas. By default, it bans:
**all elite affixes except Celestine**, mostly useless (**Fuel Array**), useless (**Crowdfunder, Ocular HUD, Milky Chrysalis, Forgive Me Please**), and annoying (**Eccentric Vase, Recycler, Glowing Meteorite**).

A further list can be accessed at : https://github.com/risk-of-thunder/R2Wiki/wiki/Item-&-Equipment-IDs-and-Names. For modded equipment, launch the game with DebugToolkit and use `list_equip` in console.
