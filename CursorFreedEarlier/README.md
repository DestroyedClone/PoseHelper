# Cursor Freed Earlier
Frees your cursor when you load the game.

Or more technically, toggles your mouse on the loadingbasic scene. I downloaded a ~100 mod modpack, and my mod and my mouse was centered for only a second before being freed.

Consider using my other mod so that you don't accidentally hit Quit on the main menu while the game window isnt active but your cursor still is.
